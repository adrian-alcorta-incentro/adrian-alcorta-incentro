### ¡Hola! 👋

I'm Adrián, a frontend developer based on Spain. I've started my carrer as a web designer but a few years ago I switched from designing email templates to code them. Right now, I'm focusing on modern web technologies such React, Next, Gatsby (and so on). Something about me:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Typescript.
- 📫 You can use Slack to reach me.
- 🎧 I love videogames OST.
- 😄 A lot of people call me Ardi
- 💬 You can ask me about Loom. 
- 🍍 I love pinneapple pizza.
